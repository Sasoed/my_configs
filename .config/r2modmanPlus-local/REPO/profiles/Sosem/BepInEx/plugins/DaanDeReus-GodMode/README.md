# GodMode

**Author:** DaanDeReus (.com)
**Version:** 1.0.2

## About

My first ever mod. So I made a few dumb updates. (1, I forgot to add the mod itself to the zip lol. 2, I needed to update readme.)
I made it mostly for me and my friend.

## Features

- Prevents all incoming damage to the player.
- Toggle GodMode on/off with the **G** key.
- Always-visible on-screen status indicator.
- Works out of the box with R.E.P.O. and BepInEx.

## Usage

- Press **G** in-game to toggle GodMode.
- The status indicator in the bottom right will show if GodMode is enabled or disabled.

## Why?

I made this mod because I couldn't find a GodMode mod for R.E.P.O. that actually worked.
